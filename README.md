Overview

This project is a comprehensive food ordering system designed to facilitate easy and efficient interactions between customers and restaurant services. Utilizing a robust combination of front-end and back-end technologies, the system offers features such as real-time order tracking, menu management, and user authentication, enhancing the dining experience through digital solutions.

Backend Technologies
Spring Boot: Serves as the foundation for creating microservices, handling configuration, and bootstrapping the application, making it easy to build and deploy.
MyBatis Plus: Utilized for ORM capabilities to simplify CRUD operations directly linked with the database, enhancing the efficiency of data transactions.
Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization to secure the application and protect sensitive data.
Spring Data JPA: Used for database interactions, simplifying the persistence layer by providing repository support.
Spring MVC: Manages HTTP requests and responses, enabling RESTful service creation.
Key Components
Service Classes: Such as EmployeeService.java, OrderService.java, and UserService.java, which contain business logic and transaction management to ensure data consistency.
Repository Interfaces: Including UserMapper.java, DishMapper.java, and OrderMapper.java, which facilitate interaction with the database.
Utility Classes: SMSUtils.java for sending notifications and ValidateCodeUtils.java for generating verification codes.
Frontend Technologies
Vue.js: Drives the frontend framework, offering a reactive and component-driven environment for the user interface.
Axios: Handles HTTP requests for communicating with backend services efficiently.
Vant UI & Element UI: Provide ready-to-use UI components that are responsive and customizable for a seamless user experience.
Setup and Configuration
MyBatis Plus Configuration: Setup in MybatisPlusConfig.java to integrate MyBatis with Spring Boot, configuring connection pools and data sources.
Security Configuration: Managed through WebMvcConfig.java and GlobalExceptionHandler.java to handle web security and global error handling.
APIs and Endpoints
Order Processing: Handled through endpoints in OrderController.java, supporting operations like order placement and status updates.
User Management: Defined in UserController.java, responsible for user registration, login, and profile updates.
Database Management
Entity Classes: Such as Orders.java, User.java, and Dish.java, representing data models.
Service Implementation: Classes like OrderServiceImpl.java and UserServiceImpl.java manage database transactions and business logic.
Exception Handling
Custom exceptions and error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage and log errors efficiently, ensuring that the system remains robust under various error conditions.
Running the Application
The application can be started from ReggieApplication.java, which sets up the Spring Boot application. Ensure all configurations are set correctly in application.properties or application.yml before launch.
Conclusion
This project not only focuses on functionality but also emphasizes security, performance, and user experience. With a clean and modular architecture, it provides a scalable solution to restaurant management and online food ordering systems.
